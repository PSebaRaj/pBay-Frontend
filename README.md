An eBay clone, built with Go and React (Typescript). Backend can be found [here](https://github.com/PSebaRaj/pbay)

Goal is to implement microservices, rather than the monolithic approach that was taken for my other projects (TradingPlatform, etc.), as well as implement RPCs (gRPC)

## Dependencies


Note: This project runs React-router-dom v5.3.0, not v6
